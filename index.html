      <h1>Walk the path</h1>
      <p>Living by the CðŸ˜ŽDE</p>
      <h1>I was born and spent my early life on the Western shore of MD</h1>
      <p>I was rarely in one spot for so long</p>
      <h1>I take much pleasure in creative, erratic and engaging activities but I also love to balance with unique relaxtion methods</h1>
      <p>Some of these include a passion for motorsports, other extreme sports, art, numbers, technology, exploring nature and cities, plus more </p>
      <h1>What is my ideal career...?</h1>
      <p>I am a naturally restless person who needs a variety of stimulation, I would have a main focus, a side project, and a passion, one where I am able to actively travel often as well. </p>
      <h1>Where do I reside currently?</h1>
      <p>Central Florida, the first time away from a coast. Good thing Florida is a thin state..</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It was always something I found fun to do, we are apart of a society that has been transitioning from the Industrial Era to the Digital Age which I can absolutely see and be sure I am apart of this progression with ease and enjoyment. My most piqued interest is in blockchain technology.</p>
